Oxygen_White_LeftHanded_mouse_cursors
=====================================

The (X11) mouse cursors (pointers) that come with (among others) openSUSE KDE installations, converted for left-handedness.

# LICENSE NOTE:
  The **real** license for these is the same as the right-handed version that ships with openSUSE/KDE. I have not been able to **definitively** determine what that is, but I **believe** it is the GPL v3 (or greater), so that is what I have said.

# OBSOLESENCE NOTE:
  While trying to determine the license to use, I came across Marcus Haro's published implementation (under the LGPL license) here:
    http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/Oxygen+White+Left+Handed?content=165028
  I have no reason to assume that my version is better than his; and, indeed, his contains substantially more files; and his description at the above link indicates more testing on more platforms.

  **=> You should probably just use the above version rather than this one.**
